  <section id="about">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Connect to and view your local MySQL databases.</li>
      <li>Query your database using natural language instead of writing tedious SQL queries. 
        No need to ask in generic langugage, ask contextual questions specific to your data.</li>
      <li>Upon writing your query in natural language, the application will build a SQL query and 
        exectute the query on the database and show you the retrieved data and a brief summary of the response in natural langugae as well. </li>
      <li>You can also execute manually entered SQL queries and edit the generated SQL queries and execute them again.</li>
    </ul>

  <section id="how">

      <li>The application uses local LLM that will run on your local computer. </li>
      <li>Download <a href="https://ollama.com/download">ollama</a> and pull the model <b>llama3.1</b> and make sure ollama is running with the given model.</li>

  <section id="how">
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning and building SQL queries to retrive your data is quite tedious. With all the progress in LLMs, doesn't seem right to keep having to learn and write SQL queries</li>
      <li>Using publicly available GPTs and other LLM services is also tedious, since we have to give context which is tedious and/or ask generic way to build SQL query and edit which is also tedious.</li>
      <li>Instead context should be automatically fed and the only thing we should do is ask our questions.</li>
      <li><b>Why not public LLMs or GPTs?</b> Because we are all very sensitive about our data, and sharing our context/schema with public LLMs/GPTs might not be in the best interest.</li>
      <li>So with this application, everything is running locally and your data/schema is secure.</li>
      <li>So even if you are working with sensitite enterprise data, you can use this application without any worry.</li>
    </ul>

  <section id="how">
    <h2>Future</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It is hard to imagine a future where businesses/individuals will not have the need to analyze data for better decision making.</li>
        <li>It is also hard to imagine a future where a number of businesses/individuals will not be concerned with sharing their data with other parties.</li>
      <li>The ultimate plan is to remove technical hurdles of communicating with your data in a secure way. 
        Any form of insight and analysis can be done on your data using natural language by anyone without the need of any technical expertise.</li>
    </ul>
